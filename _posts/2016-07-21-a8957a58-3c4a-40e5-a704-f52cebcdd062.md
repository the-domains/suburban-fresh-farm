# Our philosophy

# In ecology, sustainability is how biological systems remain diverse and productive.

When we started growing our own food, our original goal was to be as self-sufficient as we could be, and produce much of what we eat right here on the farm.

We believe that to do so successfully and long term, it has to be sustainable. To us that means we use as little outside inputs as possible, feed our soil, and create an environment that is wholesome and chemical free. 

We produce vegetables, herbs and flowers in our gardens during the Spring and Summer. Our main garden consists of 50 raised beds built on an old tennis court. We use compost, made here on the farm, to feed our soil and fertilize our crops. We use various mulches around our plants to retain moisture in the soil, prevent weed growth and add more organic material.

We use a combination of companion planting and plant diversity to control pests. 

We don't use ANY pesticides, not even those approved for organic production. As a result, we frequently walk through the garden and pick something delicious off the vine or plant, and eat it as we go about our business.
